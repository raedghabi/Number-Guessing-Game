A simple Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number between **1 and 100**.

## How It Works

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
2. You try to guess the number by entering your guesses.  
3. After each guess:  
   - **Too low?** The program will tell you `"Too low! Try again."`  
   - **Too high?** The program will tell you `"Too high! Try again."`  
   - **Correct?** The program will congratulate you and end the game.  
4. Invalid inputs (non-numeric entries) are handled with a warning message.
